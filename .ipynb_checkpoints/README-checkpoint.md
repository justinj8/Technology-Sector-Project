An investment analysis on the top ten technology company by market cap.

## Performance


#### Stock Price 5-year Performance
![stock price line chart](Resources/stock_price_line_chart.png)<sup><sup>

   This is a five year performance of the stock price. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) show to be the outliers compared to the other stock prices, showing exponential growth especially after 2019. One anomaly shown is Apple's (AAPL) stock price in 2020, the sharp drop in price is due to the 4-for-1 stock split which essentially decreased the price about 75%. One correlating trend that is shown for every stock price in 2020 in the drop in the February timeframe, but this visualization shows that every tech company bounced back shortly after. Another pattern that is shown is that every major decrease is across the board in tech where every company's decrease aligns.  

 
#### Heatmap of Price Correlation

This heatmap shows the correlation of one companies' stock price to another. The biggest outlier is IBM, in which is does not correlate to any other tech company's price. The outcome of this shows the biggest correlation being Adobe (ADBE)/Amazon (AMZN) & Adobe (ADBE)/Microsoft (MSFT), with 99% correlation. The least correlated is IBM/Microsoft (MSFT), with -0.46% correlation

  
#### Daily Returns Percent Change (5-year)

This chart shows the daily returns of the tech companies over the last five years. The recent 2020 outliers are Salesforce's (CRM) growth and Apple's (AAPL) decline. Apple's decline is due to the stock split which ultimately shrinked the price about 75%. The stock split increases the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders, so the decrease in stock price has no effect on the value of the company. Salesforce's growth is due to a few reasons. The company is dominating year-over-year revenues, crushing estimates by $200 million for 2020. Salesforce also started partnerships with AT&T and PayPal, which gives investors a voice of reason to expect future growth. Those two major reasons ultimately rose Saleforce (CRM) stock price exponentially.
